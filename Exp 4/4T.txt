MapReduce is a programming model and data processing framework designed for parallel and distributed computing. It divides data processing tasks into two stages: mapping data into key-value pairs, and then reducing those pairs to produce a final result, making it suitable for large-scale data processing.

MapReduce matrix multiplication is a technique used to multiply two large matrices in a distributed computing environment. In this process, the input matrices are divided into smaller blocks, and the Map function calculates the partial products for each block, emitting key-value pairs with row and column information. The Shuffling and Sorting phase groups and sorts these pairs, allowing the Reduce function to sum the partial products, resulting in the final matrix multiplication. This approach leverages parallelism and minimizes data transfer, making it suitable for large-scale matrix multiplication tasks.
